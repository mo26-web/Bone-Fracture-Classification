# Bone-Fracture-Classification
This project uses PyTorch to classify bone fractures. As well as fine-tuning some famous CNN architectures (like VGG 19, MobileNetV3, RegNet,...), we designed our own architecture. Additionally, we used Transformer architectures (such as Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer). This dataset is Bone Fracture Multi-Region X-ray, available on Kaggle.
