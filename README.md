# Bone-Fracture-Classification
This project uses PyTorch to classify bone fractures. As well as fine-tuning some famous CNN architectures (like VGG 19, MobileNetV3, RegNet,...), we designed our own architecture. Additionally, we used Transformer architectures (such as Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer). This dataset is Bone Fracture Multi-Region X-ray, available on Kaggle.
## Bone Fracture Multi-Region X-ray Dataset
The dataset includes fractured and non-fractured X-ray images covering all anatomical body regions, including the lower limb, upper limb, lumbar region, hips, knees, etc. The dataset is divided into three folders, each containing fractured and non-fractured radiographic images. The dataset can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bmadushanirodrigo/fracture-multi-region-x-ray-data/data.
